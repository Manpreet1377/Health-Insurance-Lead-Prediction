# Health-Insurance-Lead-Prediction
A financial services company provides various financial services like loan, investment funds, insurance etc. to its customers. The company now wishes to cross-sell health insurance to the existing customers who may or may not hold insurance policies with the company. They recommend health insurance to it's customers based on their profile once these customers land on the website. The company needs help in building a model to predict whether the person will be interested in their proposed Health plan/policy given their information in the forms filled by them on the website. This is a binary classification problem.
